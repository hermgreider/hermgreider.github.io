  <h1>Pickle Wars</h1>
  <p>A large bit of my work at Jungle Jim’s has consisted of festival promotion and design – but it wasn’t until the
    then brand new festival, Pickle Wars, was tossed on my lap that I was able to explore creating an
    experiential system that was both accessible to vistors while having overall goofy and lighthearted atmostphere.
  </p>

  <p>
    From a 10 foot Pickle Godzilla to 12 inch gold wrestling belts, this was a chance to really get wacky with it and
    have a ton of fun with the festival experience.

  <h1>Installations</h1>
  <h2>Nepal Mural</h2>

  <p>
    The largest thing I ever installed at Jungle Jim’s was the entryway to a new 2000 sq ft addition to the store. The
    mural
    depicts the <b>Pashupatinath Temple in Kathmandu</b> with simple linework, vibrant colors, and dense texturing.
    While
    we
    didn’t have the space to make it life sized, the mural still stands at about 30 feet tall.

  <h2>Africa Hanging Display</h2>

  <p>
    Jungle Jim (the man himself) had some spare tusks laying around that he wanted used for something, so he had me
    design a
    larger than life department sign for the recently expanded Africa section in both stores. Below are a couple of
    assets
    involved in design the display and mocking it up.

    In addition to graphic design, I’ve been a large part in bringing the usability of <a

    modern era by making our databases searchable and accessible on the web! I’ve built search apps for browsing our

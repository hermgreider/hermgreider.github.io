  <h1>Ceramic Lamp with Programmable LEDs</h1>
  <p>
    This piece was the result of a collaboration with ceramic artist <a href="http://rachel.greider.org">Rachel
      Greider</a>.
    Designed as an eye-catching centerpiece, the ceramic lamp casts vibrant shadows across the ceiling. It served as a
    direct precursor to our <i>Light Portals</i> project—an essential prototype for exploring the mathematical
    algorithms involved in arranging LEDs.</p>

  <p>
    The LED rig features a custom circuit board, programmed algorithms for a microcontroller, and a seamless integration
    with the ceramic lamp form.

  <h1>Homemade Music Synthesizer (in cardboard box)</h1>
  <p>
    As a longtime keyboard player and programmer, I was interested in combining the two worlds. This
    prototype explores the potential of connecting a synthesizer with real time user interaction, through a DIY circuit
    board,
    with keyboard input, and external sensors.
  </p>
  <p>
    For this demo, instead of pre-programming a song, I've rigged it to take input from a Yamaha keyboard, paired with a
    simple
    UI to tweak parameters like a traditional synth.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the core of the project is the Daisy Seed, programmable audio hardware, designed for real time audio processing.
    It makes it easy to incorporate external sensors—like proximity or touch inputs—for dynamic sound
    modulation. It was also a fun excuse to revisit my soldering skills and build a custom circuit board to handle MIDI
    input and signal processing.
